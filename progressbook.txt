07/06:
Focus will be on analysis and preparation of the data until the end of the week.
Conclusions have to be drawn from these analyses in order to decide what kind of visualizations should be made.

Working on crawler which finds all connections between checkpoints on the map.
A working version of this has been developed.
Should only find the shortest paths and not accept double findings.
This all still has to be validated, however. A few checkpoints should be checked by hand.
These results are then compared to the results of the crawler.

Laura and Peter are working on the processing of the data points and a first version of a calendar.

Summary: Processing of the map nearly done.

08/06:
Design document not made since we are still in the analysis phase. First results have shown that the fraction of vehicle types does not vary much through the year.
This means that the third plot will have to change.
Map crawler fully functional.
